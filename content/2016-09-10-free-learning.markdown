[Naomi See](https://twitter.com/colorful_n0mi) pointed out the other day that her, currently, favorite free learning resources were 
[FreeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and 
[Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com) 
via the Omaha Public Library.

A January 11, 2015 [Omaha World-Herald article](http://www.omaha.com/living/bookends-omaha-library-offering-free-access-to-lynda-instructional-videos/article_d39a8a39-9b45-5848-ab53-1f3eaaaafc41.html) says: 

> Lynda.com, the popular online training library, is now available for Omaha Public Library patrons.
> 
> To log in, go to omahalibrary.org. On the homepage, there’s a link to Lynda.com. Enter your library card number and pin, and you’ll have access to more than 2,000 instructional videos in everything from photography to software development to 3-D rendering.
> 
> Subscriptions for Lynda.com normally start at $25 per month.

Wow!  This is wonderful!

I too am a big fan of both 
[FreeCodeCamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and 
[Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com).   
The [Computer Science and Software Engineering Theory with Briana](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmfoj2Th9fvxhHIeqFO7wOy) are fantastic!   I like that they are small and well labeled.  They can be watched in order or you can just jump to what you want to learn.

## Other free learning resources I've seen include:

I'm mostly interested in software development.

[How to teach yourself code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZKvZzRynLE) is a 17 minute interview that contains some wonderful advice.  I have put my notes from this video in a post about [teach yourself code](http://mattpayne.org/learning/2016/09/10/teach-yourself-code.html).
