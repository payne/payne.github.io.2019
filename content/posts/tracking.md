I'm excited to start using the 
[low-friction task managment system](https://github.com/CoralineAda/lftm).   I'm dreaming of combining this with [TaskWarrior.org](https://TaskWarrior.org) and the amazing open source mobile application [InThe.AM](https://inthe.am/about).

This post will hold things I've learned and things I'm trying to learn.... hopefully it will be useful to future me and perhaps future you too.

### Trying to learn
1. How to track daily habits (eating, exercise, etc)
1. How to use these tools as a sort of electronic bullet journal
1. How to use these tools to do regular retrospectives 

### Learned
1. Excitement is easy because the tools seem so amazing!
